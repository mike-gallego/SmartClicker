# SmartClicker

This script is something you might find handy whether it's to test randomness of spread to using it for your personal use to click at locations.
The part that is unique about this script is that it is user friendly and you can customize how many clicks you want, the location of the clicks, 
the speed of the clicks, and the spread of the clicks. Also mentioning that each click is a random point around the main location.

# How to use

If you want to use the exe file, you can get it from my google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IiSgMCzFlGtLw-lTW536y2Ii9yn1Diyu). If not, you can paste the code into your text editor and run it, 
assuming you have the required imports.

So once you have the application running, a box will pop up displaying your mouse x and y location in real time. This is for you to configure where you 
want the program to start. Next you have the option to set the amount of clicks you want the program to do, default being 1. The interval 
range is a randomized speed interval of the clicks, meaning the program will click randomly between the range that you put. If you don't 
want it to be random, you can just set the numbers to be the same. The spread is an amazing feature because you can control the size of the spread of 
clicks. A bigger spread will be more loose, and a smaller spread will be more compact.
